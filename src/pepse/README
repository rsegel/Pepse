trees package implementation:
Classes:
- Flora - a class containing a method for creating trees given a range.
- Tree - a class representing a tree. The tree itself is the tree trunk, and it has a list of leaves and a
list of fruits. The fruits and leaves are randomly generated in a square around the top of the tree.
- Fruit - a class representing a fruit. Fruits change color when the avatar jumps and dissapear when the
avatar collides with them.
- Leaf - a class representing a leaf. Leaves oscillate independently of each other and rotate 90 degrees
when the avatar jumps.

Relations between classes:
Flora's method returns a list of trees. Each tree has a list of leaves and a list of fruits, which are
transparent to Flora. Trees are also in charge of updating their leaves and fruit that a jump occurred.

Design patterns:
- Observer - the avatar is the subject and the trees are the observers. The avatar notifies the trees when it
jumps, and each tree notifies its leaves and fruits.
